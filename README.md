# Pure CSS Fire Animation

Very simple CSS animation.
Two 'solid noise' background layers sliding in different directions,
blended together with 'difference' blend mode.

Based on an earlier repo of mine,
[blend-smoke](https://github.com/helderman/blend-fire),
and some experiments I did on [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/).

You can see it in action here:
